# Family Walkie Talkie – Project Plan

## Vision
A communication and safety app designed for families and trusted groups.
It works as a normal chat app in daily life and transforms into a powerful
emergency and walkie-talkie system in critical situations.

---

## Core Modes

### 1. Normal Mode (Daily Use)
- Text messages (like WhatsApp)
- Voice messages
- Media sharing (photos, videos)
- One-to-one and group chats
- Custom notifications (system-based)

---

### 2. Family Mode (Priority & Safety)
- Walkie-talkie voice communication (push-to-talk)
- Auto-play incoming voice (no accept needed)
- Emergency red button
- Strong emergency ringtone (app-embedded, bypasses silent mode)
- Voice recording fallback if live audio is not heard
- Location sharing (last location or live tracking – owner controlled)

---

## Emergency Features

### Emergency Button (Red Button)
- Short press: prepare voice transmission
- Long press:
  - Sends emergency alert
  - Sends live location
  - Optional continuous location tracking
  - Optional loud emergency sound to selected person (not whole group)
  - Optional photo capture (front or back camera)

All options are configurable by the Family Owner.

## Family Ownership & Control

### Family Owner
- Controls all emergency settings for family members
- Can enable/disable:
  - Emergency features
  - Location tracking
  - AI-based emergency actions
- Family members do NOT need to configure emergency settings manually

### Friends
- No remote control
- Each friend manages their own settings
- No family-level permissions

---

## AI Safety Layer (Optional)

### Theft Detection
- Multiple failed unlock attempts
- Sends location + emergency alert
- Continues tracking (if enabled by owner)

### Health / Unconsciousness Detection
- Integration with smartwatch (heart rate, motion)
- If no smartwatch:
  - AI analyzes usage patterns and inactivity
- AI decides whether to:
  - Alert family
  - Suggest emergency call
  - Auto-call emergency services (last resort)

All AI actions require prior user/family consent.

---

## Emergency Services Integration
- If emergency services answer:
  - Live microphone opens automatically
  - Last recorded audio is played if user is silent
- Family members may receive a button to call emergency services manually

---

## Map System
- Simple map by default
- Detailed tracking only during emergency
- Designed to be clear and fast, not complex

---

## Languages
- Arabic
- English
- German

---

## Principles
- Safety first
- Family control
- Minimal interaction during emergencies
- Clear separation between family and friends
- Privacy and consent by design
